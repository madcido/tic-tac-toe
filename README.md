Assignment: build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns

Author: Fabio Carmo / Daniel Montiel



Game description: 

This is a good old regular tic-tac-toe game, where two human players take turns placing their own marks in the tiles of a 3x3 board. The first one to place 3 marks in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row wins the game.
In our version of the game, the tiles of the board are enumerated from 1 to 9 and, on each turn, the current active player has to input a number corresponding to the chosen tile. The chosen tile will be marked and the board will be shown between turns, to make everything clear. After the victory condition is met or the players come into a tie, it will be asked if they want to play again. The players can play again how many times they want. After choosing not to play again and exit the game, the final scores and the biggest winner will be shown.
